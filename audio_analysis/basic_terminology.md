**Note**
Harmonic and Percussion components of music: The aim of the Harmonic/Percussive separation is to decompose the original music signal to the harmonic (i.e. pitched instruments) and the percussive (non pitched instruments, percussion) parts of the signal. Such methods can be applied to audio mixing software, or can be adopted as preprocessing on other Music Information Retrieval Methods such as rhythm analysis or chord/tonality recognition.

The method is based on the assumption that harmonic components exhibit horizontal lines on the spectrogram while the percussive sounds are evident as vertical lines. By adopting Non-Linear image filters applied to the spectrogram in order to filter out these component, the proposed method is simple, intuitive and does not make any prior assumption of the genre,style or instrumentation of the target music.

- **Pitch**: 
	- The perceived pitch of a sound is just the ear's response to frequency, i.e., for most practical purposes the pitch is just the frequency.  
	- Although for most practical purposes, the pitch of a sound can be said to be simply a measure of its frequency, there are circumstances in which a constant frequency sound can be perceived to be changing in pitch. One of most consistently observed "psychoacoustic" effects is that a sustained high frequency sound (>2kHz) which is increased steadily in intensity will be perceived to be rising in pitch, whereas a low frequency sound (<2kHz) will be perceived to be dropping in pitch.
	- The perception of the pitch of short pulses differs from that of sustained sounds of the same measured frequency. If a short pulse of a pure tone is decaying in amplitude, it will be perceived to be higher in pitch than an identical pulse which has steady amplitude.



- **Timbre**: 
	-Sound "quality" or "timbre" describes those characteristics of sound which allow the ear to distinguish sounds which have the same pitch and loudness. Timbre is then a general term for the distinguishable characteristics of a tone. Timbre is mainly determined by the harmonic content of a sound and the dynamic characteristics of the sound such as vibrato and the attack-decay envelope of the sound.	
	- Timbre distinguishes different types of sound production, such as choir voices and musical instruments, such as string instruments, wind instruments, and percussion instruments.
	- The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include spectrum and envelope.
	- In simple terms, timbre is what makes a particular musical sound have a different sound from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness.For instance, it is the difference in sound between a guitar and a piano playing the same note at the same volume. 


- **Texture**:
	- “Texture” is sometimes used loosely to mean “the timbre of multiple instruments playing together” – for example talking about a music recording which has a “simple, sparse texture” or a “complex, ever-changing texture.” This is a common usage in the world of music production when discussing audio frequencies and effects.
	- A more specific definition of texture is used in music theory and harmonic analysis which specifies the number of distinct “voices” present in the music and how they relate to each other. 
	The texture of music can fall into a number of distinct categories, including:
		- Monophonic: This is an unaccompanied melody. Think of humming to yourself or a saxophone playing a wailing melody without any accompaniment. 
		- Homophonic: This means a melody which has an accompaniment. Most pop and rock songs are homophonic: the singer performs with a band supporting them. 
		- Polyphonic: This is where there is more than one melody, each basically independent of the others. A popular technique in Renaissance and Baroque music!

	- Of these three terms, “tone” is perhaps the one that is used most frequently among both musicians and non-musicians (and often incorrectly). While “timbre” refers to the quality of sounds among different instruments, “tone” can be used to refer to the quality and frequency of a sound as compared to itself. This sounds complicated, but what it really boils down to is the difference in frequencies of low sounds (“bass”) and high sounds (“treble”).
	- As an example, imagine that you are listening to someone playing an electric guitar. The guitar’s tone control is turned all the way to the lowest frequency setting so that it produces a very deep and low sound. Suddenly, the guitarist moves the tone control all the way to the highest setting so that the sound is very piercing and sharp. The timbre of this instrument is unchanged and they may repeat the same notes as before, but the tone has been altered dramatically.
