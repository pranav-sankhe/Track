# README

I maintain the documentation and functions required for audio analysis in this folder. None of the documentation and code is exhaustive. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong and add to this repository by submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

- ``` audio_utils.py``` contains various functions for audio analysis. Comments have been added for each function. 
- ```basic_terminology.md  ``` contains explanation of terms used mainly in music domain
- ``` feature_extraction.md ``` has the documentation of various feature extraction methods 
- ``` onset&tempo.md ``` has the documentation of various onset detection techniques and tempogram computation 
- ```cepstrum_analysis.md ``` I have not successfully implemented the cepstral analysis function in the  ``` audio_utils.py``` file. This file has the summary as to what has been done yet and the plots.
