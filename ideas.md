# Ideas to Explore


## Idea No.1  
I am hugely fascinated by the human brain. And I wish to explore how our brain works; how it understands and processes information. I have been indulging myself into study
of human neural system focused mainly on perception. I am also interested in music analysis.  
Since my fifth semester, I have been working on human perception of music. I worked on extraction of tempo and beat information of music from the recorded human brain activity and got impressive results with the extracted tempo and actual tempo differing by a 1 unit.

I have been reading on human auditory system the beauty of it's design is something which amazes me. I wish to explore and work and develop on biologically inspired algorithms and proceess. 
The goal can be to come up with a novel technique inspired from biological processes and mechanism but the underlying motivation is to understand what's going on inside the 1.3 KG neural mass which we call as brain. 

Specifically speaking, I wish to use the model of human auditory system to explore the human perception of music. As of now, I have been working in the signal space of music signals which can be easily coded. I propose that we would be better off by mapping these signal features to their equivalents as perceived by the human ear. 

This is the work done as of now: [Click Here](https://github.com/sabSAThai/Perceived-Music-Information-Retrieval)


## Idea No.2 

I am a huge fan of paintings. Impressionism being one of my favourites. The blurry images creating the perfect _impression_ always attracts me. Claude Monet being my favourite painter I have been reading up and seen many of his paintings. Here during my internship at Tokyo, I am fortunate to have a muesuem which boasts an entire gallery dedicated to Monet featuring his famous water lilies as well. I have been there twice but still can't get enough of it. 
There exists a similar corresponding music genre of impressionism which has some connecting threads with impressionist paintings. The SOI(Symphony Orchestra of India) organized this seesion where they performed impressionist music and gave a lecture on the connecting links between the impressionist paintings and music. 

You must be aware of neural style transfer and inspired from this concept, I was wondering if we can study the similarities between impressionist paintings and music by comparing their style features.
